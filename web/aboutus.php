		About Ordermanza
Ordermanza is created in 2019 with the vision of being an open platform for optimized food ordering.
Ordermanza.com
By “open”, we mean that Ordermanza  provides the tools to both users and restaurants to customize their interaction with the 
platform. And by “platform”, we mean that Ordermanza is more than just a website: it is a hub where users and restaurants meet
 using a variety of different means of communication.
Food is about the people making it and about the people ordering it. Ordermanza is focused on providing a platform that
 integrates into people’s lifestyles at home, at the office, and at play. Our vision will be achieved if Ordermanza helps you 
 to be more time-efficient, healthier, and happier.
Ordermanza  is designed for interaction and user feedback. If there is something about the service that you want to change or
 a new feature that you want to see, please let us know and we will consider adding it!
Below is a list of some features currently available from the Ordermanza platform, to name a few:
1.	Individual ordering - Order some food by yourself for either pickup or delivery.
2.	Group ordering - Get together with some friends and order all at once.
3.	Domains - Group ordering for corporations or other secure environments.
4.	Payments - Credit cards always accepted for all restaurants.
5.	Apps - Log on to the platform via the website, Android app.
6.	Accessibility - Interact with the platform in English or Hindi.
